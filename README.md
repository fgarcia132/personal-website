## Milestone 2a Feedback
This project needs to be re-created and fixed before you can begin development on your PWP.

I see that this is a new repository, and the feedback from Milestone 1 was not archived. This presents a problem because the track record for your project is now missing. Please archive all feedback for this project as this affects grading.

Based on your Milestone 2a documentation, the wireframe is incomplete. Please include the required contact form in the wireframe, along with the portfolio section that is mentioned in your Sitemap section of the document, if you plan to include this feature. Please see the [Milestone 2&alpha; Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) for all requirements. Your wireframe in general needs more detail in order to be a functional skeleton for development.

Content Strategy is incomplete, as there is nothing addressing the footer and header sections. So far these sections look like you plan to keep them empty. Please see the [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for an example.

See the Edits &amp; Suggestions section below for technical fixes. **I cannot pass this Milestone until all fixes are complete.**

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- .idea directory found in repository. You're going to need to delete and recreate the repository. Be sure to archive all files in this project first.
- Directory structure is incorrect. See [Milestone One Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/)
- All Milestone documents and files must be inside the /documentation directory.
- Complete the wireframe and content strategy documentation.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback - Updated
This is great - nice work cleaning things up. This layout should be a breeze using Bootstrap. FYI, FontAwesome has the majority of social media icons included. Your directory structure is correct now, and all Milestone requirements have been met. Because this was submitted late, your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

You are clear to begin development on your PWP.
